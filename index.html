# Step 0

Welcome back!

> This week we're going to keep working with
text, we'll do some analysis of **all of Shakespeare's sonnets**
(seemed like a good fit for the week of Valentine's day).

We assume that you've finished all the way through Step 3 of the
Week 2 exercises. If you haven't finished that yet, feel free to
go back and finish that now, and we'll see you
when you're done.

## Splitting strings - review

Remember from last week that there is a `split()` method you can
call on a string value, and that returns an array of smaller strings:

```
let w = 'These are some words';
let x = w.split(' '); // ['These', 'are', 'some', 'words']
let y = x.length; // 4
let z = y[2]; // 'some'
```

By calling `split(' ')` on a string, you can break the string up into
an array of words with the spaces removed.

> **CHALLENGE**: to proceed, go ahead and update
`step_0.js` to `log()` so that it logs both the length of the string
provided and the 3rd word in that string
</script>

<script id="step1" type="text/plain">
# Step 1

Now let's take a deeper dive on the `split` function

## Splitting Strings - cont'd

Did you wonder what the `' '` was when we called `split(' ')`?

That's the rule that the function is using to decide what to split
on. If instead you did:

```
let x = 'some-separated-words';
let y = x.split('-'); // ['some', 'separated', 'words'];
```

The term for this separating string is the **delimiter**. If you get
sent a string with a bunch of values **delimited** by a comma, for example,
you'd refer to that as a **comma-delimited** list of values.

## Quick aside: newlines

We've said before that you can use a `string` to represent any written text,
like a sentence, or a poem, or a full novel. So how does a computer represent
text that takes more than one line??

There's a special character `'\n'` that computers use to represent the data of
"ok, time to start a new line of text." Even though `'\n'` looks like 2 different
characters, the computer treats them as just one.

So the text that you see on the screen as:

```
This is one line
and this is another.
```

is represented in a variable as something like:

```
let x = 'This is one line\nand this is another.';
```

> **Check-in**: if the newline character is just `'\n'`, then why
does the above have `\nand`? Remember that computers aren't looking
for words in strings, they're just reading characters, so after it
reads `\n`, it immediately starts with the word `and` at the beginning
of the next line.

## Challenge Time

Ok, for the challenge for Step 1, we're going to implement a function
that will be given a spreadsheet of information, in string form:

* You can split the string on newlines (`'\n'`) to get the rows of data
* You can split each line of data on commas (`','`) to get the columns of data for that row
* Log the number of rows of data (including the first row)
* Log the data at:
  * Row 0, Column 2
  * Row 1, Column 0

Got all that? Awesome, let's get started!

> **Challenge**: update `step_1.js` to parse the data given, and log the specific data above


</script>

<script id="step2" type="text/plain">
# Step 2

Let's chat about a place where our "split a string into words" work
starts to fall apart:

```
let x = 'Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none';
let y = x.split(' ');
let z = y[1]; // 'all,'
```

> **Check-in**: why is the value of `z` equal to `'all,'`,
instead of just `'all'`? Because we're splitting on spaces,
which leaves in stuff like punctuation!

## Regex - What is it

Regex (or **Reg**ular **Ex**pressions) is an incredibly powerful
way of doing pattern matching with strings.

You can do incredibly powerful things with Regex [like this](https://regex101.com/r/kI6rE7/1)
to scan text and look for certain patterns.

> If you want to explore Regex, [https://www.regex101.com](https://www.regex101.com) is a great resource
for trying it out

**DISCLAIMER**: Regex is super powerful, and also notoriously error-prone, since small
changes in patterns can have huge impacts. Use with caution.

## Regex - Using it to split text more effectively

For our use case, let's say instead of "split the string on spaces", we
want our function to "split the string on non-letters".

We can pass a Regex pattern into `split` to do that:

```
let x = 'Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none';
let y = x.split(/[^a-zA-Z]+/);
let z = y[1]; // 'all'
```

which now correctly ignores the punctuation!!

The `/[^a-zA-Z]+/` bit is the Regex pattern, and it's
saying to look for "one or more characters that are not English letters",
so that will split on not just spaces, but also punctuation.

## Challenge - Count lines from Shakespeare

We're going to give you a string containing all the sonnets from Shakespeare
as one very long string, and give you a line number. Your job is to:

* Log the length of that string (how many characters long)
* Log the total number of lines in that string
* Log the 3rd word in the requested line

> Open `step_2.js` and implement the above criteria!
